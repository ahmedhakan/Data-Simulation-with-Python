<h2>🧐 Project Overview</h2>


*   Imported restaurant dataset from Excel containing key metrics (e.g. customer arrivals order times revenue etc.).
*   Simulated various scenarios affecting restaurant operations such as peak hours staff changes and chef added adjustments.
*   Processed data using Pandas and SimPy for analysis and manipulation.
*   Generated visualizations using VScode to illustrate the impact of different variables on restaurant performance.

<h2>🛠️ Key Features</h2>

<p>✔️ Excel Integration: Read and process structured restaurant data from Excel sheets.</p>

<p>✔️ Implement Libraries: Simpy is a powerful Python library for process-based simulation, there for it will make
different progress.</p>

<p>✔️ Using Classes and atributes: Restraunt class, Customer class, Its includes initialization of the environment for the customer. </p>

<p>✔️ Graphical Analysis: Outputted meaningful graphs and charts to visualize key trends and changes.</p>

<p>✔️ Scalability: The framework can be adapted for other businesses or industries by adjusting input data.</p>
